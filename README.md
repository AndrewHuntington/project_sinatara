# Ruby on Rails
### Project: Sinatra Project
Two projects to dip my toes into back-end development and to begin to learn MVC.

## Project 1: Caesar Cipher Reloaded
A front end for my Caesar cipher code created for a previous project.

## Project 2: Hangman
I've never played Mastermind, so I've decided to go with hangman.
